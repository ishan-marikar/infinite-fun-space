Content Addressable
===================

_Content Addressable_ is my personal notebook, a collection of files for my own
benefit. You're welcome to poke around.

A GitHub repository is the perfect place for a notebook. You can browse the
files online, it renders markdown files and also offers the raw versions.
You can edit and preview files in browser. See the history of the entire
notebook or of a single file or folder. Git clone the repository, edit in vim
and search with ack. You might even receive issues and pull requests.
And it's a lot simpler and less distracting than blog or wiki software.
